What happens if we delete the 'Sports shoes' node?
The entire root node 'Shoes' will get deleted.
The parent node 'Kids shoes' will get deleted.
Only the node 'Casual' will get deleted.
Nothing - you cannot delete or edit any nodes in the Hierarchial structure.
Status:
Excellent work!

Correct Answer:

Only the node 'Casual' will get deleted.
Explanation:
Whenever any node is deleted - that node and its subsequent child nodes will get deleted.

Hence - 'Shoes' and 'Kids shoes' will remain unaffected as they are the parent nodes.

Only 'Casuals' will get deleted.
