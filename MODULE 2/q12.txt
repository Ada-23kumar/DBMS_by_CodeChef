Which of the following possible relations will NOT hold if the above ERD is mapped into a relation model?

Person (NID, Name)
Qualification (NID, ExamID, QualifiedDate)
Exam (ExamID, NID, ExamName)
Exam (ExamID, ExamName)
Status:
Hooray, you did it!

Correct Answer:

Exam (ExamID, NID, ExamName)
Explanation:
If we convert an ER diagram into relational model then we can create table for each entity. We get two tables One for Entity Person - Person(NID,Name) One for Entity Exam - Exam(ExamID,ExamName) Now for relationship Entity Qualification, we can not add QualifiedDate in any of the two tables formed so we need to create a new table using Primary Key from both Entity Person and Entity Exam. We obtain Qualification(NID, ExamID, QualifiedDate) Hence Option (C) does not make any sense.
