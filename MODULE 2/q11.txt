Correct Answer:

Min 2, Max 3
Explanation:
Maximum number of tables required is 3 in case of many to many relationships between entities. Minimum number of tables is 1 in case of unary relationship and total participation of atleast one entity. But in case of partial participation of both entities, minimum number of tables required is 2.
