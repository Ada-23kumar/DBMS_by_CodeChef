In an Entity-Relationship (ER) model, suppose R is a many-to-one relationship from entity set E1 to entity set E2. Assume that E1 and E2 participate totally in R and that the cardinality of E1 is greater than the cardinality of E2.

Which one of the following is true about R?
Every entity in E1 is associated with exactly one entity in E2.
Some entity in E1 is associated with more than one entity in E2.
Every entity in E2 is associated with exactly one entity in E1.
Every entity in E2 is associated with at most one entity in E1.
Status:
Perfect answer!

Correct Answer:

Every entity in E1 is associated with exactly one entity in E2.
Explanation:
The things we have are:
- Many to One Relationship.
- Cardinality of E1 is more than that of E2.
- A Total Participation.

Since we have E1 to E2 relationship, and it is a Many to One relationship, thus it will always have to be exactly one entity in E2 thus option B and D are eliminated. 

And since, it's a total participation and cardinality of E1 is more, then option C cannot be true. 

Thus A is correct!
