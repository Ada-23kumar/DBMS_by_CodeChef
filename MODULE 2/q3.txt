Status:
Excellent work!

Correct Answer(s):

The maximum participation of B in the relationship is M
Every entry in A is associated with at exactly one entry in B
Explanation:
For A, we can say the following
- Both minimum and maximum participation is 1 since A has a many to one relation with B and complete participation in the relation

For B, we can say the following
- Minimum participation is 0 and Maximum participation is M

The maximum participation of B in the relationship is M    - this is correct
    
Every entry in B is associated with at least one entry in A - this is incorrect since we know that B has participated partially in the relation.
    
Every entry in A is associated with at exactly one entry in B - this is correct since we know that A has participated totally. 
    
The minimum participation of A in the relation is 0 - this is correct since we know that A has participated totally.
