Correct Answer:

Number of attributes of its relation schema.
Explanation:
The degree (or arity) of a relation in a relational database system refers to the number of attributes (or fields) of its relation schema. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.

The degree is a fundamental property of the relation that does not change with the number of tuples/rows stored in the relation, or with the number of entries in the relation. Moreover, the degree does not directly depend on the number of distinct domains of its relation schema.
