A
B
C
D
Status:
Excellent work!

Correct Answer:

C
Explanation:
Let's see a Projection Query first: 
π(Roll No, Department)(Table consisting of students whose marks are greater than 80%)

And we use the selection query to get the table of students whose marks are more than 80%. Which will be:
σ(Marks > 80)(Students)

So merging the two we get: π(Roll No, Department)(σ(Marks > 80)(Students))
