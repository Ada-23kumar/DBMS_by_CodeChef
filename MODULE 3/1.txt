Perfect answer!

Correct Answer(s):

The number of columns will increase.
The total number of cells will increase.
Explanation:
The number of rows will remain fixed as we aren't changing the number of students.

The number of columns will increase as we are added a new column.

On adding a new column, the total count of cells will also increase.

We can always add a column even after the table is created using SQL queries.
