Can you tell what type of Database Architecture is Chef Using?
Single Tier
Two Tier
Three Tier
Any of the DBMS Architecture will throw the same message.
Status:
You got it right!

Correct Answer:

Three Tier
Explanation:
Only in a three tier architecture you can add an API middleware to check whether the user has an access to the data base. You can add only restricted people who can access the DB!
