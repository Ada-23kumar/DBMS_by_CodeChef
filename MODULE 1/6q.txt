Chefina was working in the kitchen with some delicious food data.
She was using file systems for storing and retrieving them, Chef came in and adviced her to use some sort of a database?
What do you think could be the probable reason?

Select all that apply.
Files cannot store data but Data Bases can
File systems cannot support multiple users simultaneously accessing the data, but a DB can
Since their kitchen has a lot of food data, and will also keep getting biggest, files systems sruggles with scalability, thus a Database is a better choice
Their kitchen needs fast access to the food data, using file systems will need more time compared to use a Data Base

Excellent work!
