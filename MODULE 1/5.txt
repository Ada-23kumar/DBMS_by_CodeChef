Which of the following statements are correct?
2-Tier Architecture is cheaper than 3-Tier Architecture
3-Tier Architecture is the most simple architecture to set up, as only a single machine is required to maintain it.
3-Tier Architecture can be easily deployed, and hence it is mostly used in small projects. 
3-Tier Architecture maintains Data Integrity.
Since there is a middle layer between the client and the server, data corruption can be avoided/removed.
Status:
Well done, itâ€™s correct!

Correct Answer(s):

2-Tier Architecture is cheaper than 3-Tier Architecture
3-Tier Architecture maintains Data Integrity.
Since there is a middle layer between the client and the server, data corruption can be avoided/removed.
Explanation:
Advantages of 2-Tier Architecture
- Easy to Access: 2-Tier Architecture makes easy access to the database, which makes fast retrieval.
- Scalable: We can scale the database easily, by adding clients or upgrading hardware.
- Low Cost: 2-Tier Architecture is cheaper than 3-Tier Architecture and Multi-Tier Architecture.
- Easy Deployment: 2-Tier Architecture is easier to deploy than 3-Tier Architecture.
- Simple: 2-Tier Architecture is easily understandable as well as simple because of only two components.

Advantages of 3-Tier Architecture
- Enhanced scalability: Scalability is enhanced due to the distributed deployment of application servers. Now, individual connections need not be made between the client and server.
- Data Integrity: 3-Tier Architecture maintains Data Integrity. Since there is a middle layer between the client and the server, data corruption can be avoided/removed.
- Security: 3-Tier Architecture Improves Security. This type of model prevents direct interaction of the client with the server thereby reducing access to unauthorized data.
